# BGP Route Server Tool - Complete Guide

## Overview

The BGP Route Server Tool provides direct access to Hurricane Electric's global network of route servers, enabling you to analyze BGP routing information, perform traceroutes, and understand internet routing from multiple geographic vantage points around the world. This powerful tool gives you the same view of the internet that major ISPs and content providers have.

## What is BGP?

**Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)** is the routing protocol that makes the internet work. It's how autonomous systems (AS) - large networks operated by ISPs, corporations, and other organizations - exchange routing information to determine the best paths for data to travel across the internet.

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Analyzing BGP Paths

**Scenario**: Understanding how traffic reaches your website from different locations

**Steps**:
1. Connect to a route server near your users
2. Run `show ip bgp <your-server-ip>`
3. Note the AS path
4. Connect to servers in other regions
5. Compare AS paths to identify routing differences

**Example Output**:
```
BGP routing table entry for 8.8.8.8/32
Paths: (3 available, best #1)
  15169
    206.81.80.0 from 206.81.80.0
      Origin IGP, metric 0, localpref 100, valid, external, best
```

### 2. Troubleshooting Connectivity Issues

**Scenario**: Users in Europe can't reach your US-based service

**Steps**:
1. Connect to a European route server (e.g., Frankfurt)
2. Run `traceroute <your-service-ip>`
3. Identify where packets are dropped or delayed
4. Check `show ip bgp <your-service-ip>` for routing issues
5. Compare with working regions

### 3. Verifying BGP Announcements

**Scenario**: Confirming your prefixes are visible globally

**Steps**:
1. Connect to multiple route servers
2. Run `show ip bgp <your-prefix>`
3. Verify your AS is the origin
4. Check AS path length from different locations
5. Ensure consistent visibility

### 4. Investigating DDoS Mitigation

**Scenario**: Understanding traffic redirection during attacks

**Steps**:
1. Connect to servers near the attack source
2. Check BGP paths before and during mitigation
3. Verify anycast or scrubbing center redirection
4. Monitor path changes over time

## Advanced Techniques

### AS Path Analysis

Understanding AS paths helps identify:
- **Routing Efficiency**: Shorter paths generally mean better performance
- **Transit Providers**: Which networks carry your traffic
- **Peering Relationships**: Direct connections between networks
- **Routing Anomalies**: Unusual or suboptimal paths

**Example AS Path**: `701 1299 15169`
- 701: Verizon
- 1299: Telia
- 15169: Google (destination)

### Multi-Location Comparison

1. **Create a Testing Matrix**:
   - List target IPs/services
   - Select diverse route server locations
   - Document normal baselines

2. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Check paths during different times
   - Note changes in routing
   - Identify patterns or issues

3. **Performance Correlation**:
   - Compare BGP paths with actual performance
   - Identify correlation between path length and latency
   - Find optimal peering points

### BGP Community Analysis

Communities are tags that control routing policies:
- **NO_EXPORT**: Don't advertise outside AS
- **NO_ADVERTISE**: Don't advertise to any peer
- **Customer Communities**: Provider-specific tags

Check communities with extended BGP commands when available.

## Best Practices

### 1. Server Selection
- Start with geographically close servers
- Use multiple servers for comprehensive analysis
- Consider network topology, not just geography

### 2. Command Sequencing
- Begin with `show ip bgp summary` to verify connectivity
- Use broader commands before specific queries
- Save output for comparison and documentation

### 3. Data Interpretation
- Understand AS numbers (use ASN lookup tool)
- Learn common transit provider AS numbers
- Recognize private AS numbers (64512-65535)

### 4. Documentation
- Record baseline routing for your networks
- Document changes during incidents
- Create runbooks for common scenarios

## Integration with Other Tools

### Subnet Calculator
- Calculate network prefixes for BGP queries
- Understand subnet boundaries in routing
- Plan BGP announcements

### ASN Lookup
- Identify AS numbers from BGP output
- Research organizations behind AS numbers
- Understand peering relationships

### Traceroute Tool

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Connection Issues

**"Connection timeout" Error**
- Check internet connectivity
- Verify firewall allows telnet (port 23)
- Try a different route server

**"Authentication failed"**
- The password is automatically provided
- If issues persist, try reconnecting
- Check for server maintenance notices

### Command Errors

**"Unknown command"**
- Use the `?` command to list available options
- Check command syntax carefully
- Some servers may have limited command sets

**"No route to host"**
- The target may be unreachable from that location
- Try different route servers
- Verify the IP/hostname is correct

### Output Interpretation

**Empty BGP Results**
- The prefix may not be announced
- Check for typos in IP address
- Try a broader prefix (e.g., /24 instead of /32)

**Multiple Paths**
- Normal for well-connected destinations
- Best path is marked with ">"
- Consider all paths for redundancy analysis

## Security Considerations

### Read-Only Access
- Route servers provide view-only access
- Cannot modify routing tables
- Safe for learning and analysis

### Information Disclosure
- BGP data is public information
- Don't rely on obscurity for security
- Assume attackers can see routing too

### Rate Limiting
- Be respectful of shared resources
- Avoid excessive queries
- Use output caching when possible

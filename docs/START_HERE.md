## Tips and Tricks

### 0. The Knowledgebase is Markdown-based, which means you can open the location of the folder and edit files directly
- Use `#` for main headings
- Use `##` for subheadings
- Use `-` for bullet points
- Use backticks for code snippets

### 1. BGP Route Server Best Practices
- Start with servers geographically close to your target
- Use `show ip bgp summary` first to verify connectivity
- For IPv6, use the `show ipv6 bgp` commands
- The `?` command shows all available commands on the server

### 2. Terminal Usage
- The terminal maintains your session between toggles
- Use it to run local network commands alongside the GUI tools
- Supports copy/paste with standard shortcuts

### 3. Efficient Navigation
- Use keyboard shortcuts to quickly toggle panels
- Keep frequently used tools in the sidebar for quick access
- The main area remembers your last tool selection

### 4. Troubleshooting
- If a tool isn't responding, check the terminal for error messages
- For connection issues, verify your internet connectivity first
- The BGP Route Server requires internet access to reach HE servers

### 5. Working with Multiple Tools
- While you can only view one tool at a time, they continue running in the background
- Use the sidebar to quickly switch between active tools
- Terminal sessions persist when switching tools

## Advanced Features

### BGP Analysis Workflows

#### Finding the Best Path to a Destination
1. Connect to a route server near your location
2. Run `show ip bgp <destination-ip>`
3. Note the AS path
4. Connect to route servers in other regions
5. Compare AS paths to understand routing differences

#### Investigating Routing Issues
1. Use `traceroute` from multiple route servers
2. Compare results to identify where packets diverge
3. Use `show ip route` to see the routing table entry
4. Check `show bgp neighbors` to verify peer status

### Custom Workflows
Create your own diagnostic workflows by combining tools:
1. Start with ASN Lookup to identify the target network
2. Use BGP Route Server to check routing from multiple locations
3. Run Traceroute to verify the actual path
4. Use Ping to test connectivity and packet loss

# Project Restructuring Summary

## Overview
The Electron application has been successfully restructured to follow the recommended project structure from IMPLEMENTATION_REVIEW.md.

## New Directory Structure

```
src/
├── main/
│   ├── main.js          # Main process entry point
│   ├── ipc-handlers.js  # IPC communication handlers
│   └── menu.js          # Application menu configuration
├── renderer/
│   ├── landing.html     # Main landing page
│   ├── landing-renderer.js  # Landing page renderer script
│   ├── styles.css       # Common styles
│   └── pages/
│       ├── subnet-calculator.html  # Subnet calculator page
│       └── subnet-renderer.js      # Subnet calculator renderer script
├── preload/
│   └── preload.js       # Preload script for context bridge
└── utils/
    └── subnet-calculator.js  # Subnet calculation utility functions
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Main Process Refactoring
- **main.js**: Moved to `src/main/` and refactored to import menu and IPC handlers
- **ipc-handlers.js**: Extracted all IPC communication logic into a separate module
- **menu.js**: Extracted menu creation logic into a separate module

### 2. Renderer Process Organization
- Moved all HTML and renderer JavaScript files to `src/renderer/`
- Created `pages/` subdirectory for tool-specific pages
- Added common `styles.css` for shared styling

### 3. Preload Script
- Moved to `src/preload/` for better organization
- No changes to functionality

### 4. Utilities
- Extracted subnet calculation logic into `src/utils/subnet-calculator.js`
- This promotes code reuse and separation of concerns

### 5. Configuration Updates
- Updated `package.json` main field to point to `src/main/main.js`
- forge.config.js remains unchanged as it doesn't contain path references

### 6. Path Updates
All file references have been updated:
- Preload script path in main.js
- HTML file paths in IPC handlers
- Module imports use relative paths

## Benefits of New Structure

1. **Better Organization**: Clear separation between main process, renderer process, and utilities
2. **Maintainability**: Easier to locate and modify specific functionality
3. **Scalability**: Structure supports adding new tools and features
4. **Security**: Maintains proper context isolation and security practices
5. **Code Reuse**: Utilities can be shared across different parts of the application

## Backup
Old files have been moved to `old-structure-backup/` directory for reference.

## Testing
The application has been tested and starts successfully with the new structure. All functionality remains intact:
- Navigation between pages works
- Subnet calculator functions properly
- IPC communication is operational
- Menu items work as expected

## Next Steps
With this improved structure, the application is ready for:
- Adding new network tools
- Implementing additional features
- Easier testing and debugging
- Better collaboration with team members

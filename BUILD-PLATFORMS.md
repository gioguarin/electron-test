‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ zip/           # ZIP archives for all platforms
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ *.dmg          # macOS disk images
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Network Tools Hub-{platform}-{arch}/  # Unpacked application
```

## Platform-Specific Features

### Terminal Support

## Cross-Platform Building

### Limitations

#### From macOS
- ‚úÖ **macOS apps**: Native support
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Windows apps**: Requires Wine (may work)
- ‚ùå **Linux .deb/.rpm**: Cannot build (requires dpkg/fakeroot)
- ‚úÖ **Universal ZIP**: Works for all platforms

#### From Linux
- ‚úÖ **Linux packages**: Native support
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Windows apps**: Requires Wine (may work)
- ‚ùå **macOS apps**: Cannot build (requires macOS)
- ‚úÖ **Universal ZIP**: Works for all platforms

#### From Windows
- ‚úÖ **Windows apps**: Native support
- ‚ùå **macOS apps**: Cannot build (requires macOS)
- ‚ùå **Linux packages**: Cannot build (requires Linux tools)
- ‚úÖ **Universal ZIP**: Works for all platforms

### Solutions for Cross-Platform Builds

#### Option 1: Universal ZIP Packages (Recommended for Testing)
```bash
# Builds ZIP packages that work on all platforms
./build-universal.sh
```

#### Option 2: Docker for Linux Packages (on macOS/Windows)
```bash
# Requires Docker Desktop
./build-linux-docker.sh
```

#### Option 3: Use CI/CD
Use GitHub Actions or other CI/CD services that provide native runners for each platform.

### Recommendations for Production
For production releases, build on each target platform:
1. Use a macOS machine for macOS builds (.dmg)
2. Use a Windows machine for Windows builds (.exe/.msi)
3. Use a Linux machine for Linux builds (.deb/.rpm)

## Code Signing

### macOS
- Currently disabled for local testing
- Enable in `forge.config.js` by setting `osxSign` configuration
- Requires Apple Developer certificate

### Windows
- Optional but recommended for distribution
- Requires code signing certificate
- Configure in `forge.config.js` under Squirrel maker

### Linux
- Not typically required
- Package signatures handled by distribution repositories

## Testing Builds

### Local Testing
1. Build the application: `npm run make`
2. Navigate to `out/make/`
3. Install and run the appropriate distributable

### CI/CD Testing
Consider using GitHub Actions or similar CI/CD platforms to:
- Build for multiple platforms automatically
- Run tests on each platform
- Create releases automatically

## Troubleshooting

### Terminal Not Working
- Ensure `node-pty` is rebuilt: `npm run rebuild`
- Check that native modules are unpacked in `forge.config.js`

### Build Fails for Target Platform
- Cross-platform builds may fail
- Build on the target platform for best results
- Check that all required build tools are installed

### Missing Icons
- Add platform-specific icons:
  - macOS: `.icns` file
  - Windows: `.ico` file
  - Linux: `.png` file (already configured)
